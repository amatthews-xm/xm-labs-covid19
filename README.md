# covid19workflow
xMatters has developed a pre-built workflow to enable your organization to provide effective and timely COVID-19 communications with your crisis management teams, and to proactively check on the health and welfare of your employees.

We are offering a free workshop, with multiple scheduling options, to demonstrate the installation and configuration of this workflow into your xMatters instance, and provide hands-on instructions for usage. The workflow implementation should only take 30-45 minutes within your xMatters environment.
